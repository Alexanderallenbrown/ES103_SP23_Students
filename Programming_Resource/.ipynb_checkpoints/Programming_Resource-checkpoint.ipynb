    "\n",
    "**A computer program is a set of instructions that the computer will execute *sequentially* (one after the other) to perform a task or set of tasks**. In the Jupyter Notebook environment, we write our computer programs in \"code cells\" and we *execute* (run) the program by either pressing the \"run\" button in the menu bar or hitting Shift and Enter at the same time while the cell is in focus (highlighted because you clicked on it or your cursor is inside of it). \n",

You can use a **flow chart** to help you break down the tasks your program should perform into steps that can be turned into a line or a few lines of code. This will help you **plan** your program and avoid a situation where you're not sure what line of code you should be writing next!\n",

A basic tutorial on how to use www.diagrams.net to create flow charts is [here](https://www.diagrams.net/doc/getting-started-basic-flow-chart). you can use the snipping tool to turn in a picture of your program's flow chart as part of your assignments in this course!"
